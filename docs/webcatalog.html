          Thanks a lot for using the app and supporting the development! Even though many users (including myself) were still using WebCatalog, the usages were not enough to justify the costs of maintenance and hosting. Additionally, as major tech companies began to embrace <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web Apps</a> (PWA) on desktop and mobile platforms, WebCatalog would soon become legacy, inferior software. I made a promise for an entirely rewritten version of the app to improve its underlying technical implementations, but it turned out not to be a perfect solution. I believe PWA will offer a much better experience - more resource-friendly, faster & more secure. So I've decided to cease the development indefinitely.

          WebCatalog is not wholly dead. I've streamlined the app and re-released the remaining source code under a new name, <a href="https://quang.im/appifier">Appifier</a>. It doesn't have a straightforward interface like WebCatalog, but it works similarly.

          Again, thanks a lot for everything! I spent nearly one year and a half to work on WebCatalog (including a gap semester), so it was such a hard decision for me to do this. Nevertheless, building WebCatalog was a fantastic experience. And I appreciate everything you did to support its development.
