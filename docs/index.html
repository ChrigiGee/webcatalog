            WebCatalog is no longer under active development.
          </h1>
          <p>
            Thanks a lot for using the app and supporting the development! Even though many users (including myself) were still using WebCatalog, the usages were not enough to justify the costs of maintenance. Additionally, as major tech companies began to embrace <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web Apps</a> (PWA) on desktop and mobile platforms, WebCatalog would soon become legacy, inferior software. PWAs are resource-friendly, faster & more secure. Recognizing the potential advantages of PWA, I made a promise rebuild WebCatalog from scratch to improve its underlying technical implementations. But it turned out not to be a good solution. So I've decided to cease the development indefinitely.
          </p>
          <p>
            WebCatalog is not wholly dead. While I don't have plans to invest in new features, <b>I'll continue to support the app on macOS</b>. For <b>Windows & Linux users, I've spun off the app to create a streamlined version under a new name: <a href="https://quang.im/appifier">Appifier</a></b>. It doesn't have a straightforward interface like WebCatalog, but it works similarly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, thanks a lot for everything! I spent nearly one year and a half working on WebCatalog (including a gap semester), so it was such a hard decision for me to do this. Nevertheless, building WebCatalog was a fantastic experience. And I appreciate everything you did to support its development.

        <p>WebCatalog works similarly to <a href="https://quang.im/appifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Appifier</a>. But it also includes a simpler interface, a <a href="https://github.com/quanglam2807/webcatalog-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web app catalog</a> and an app manager.</p>

          Web apps like Gmail, Facebook Messenger and Instagram are becoming more and more like desktop applications. Running each of these apps in a separate tab in your browser can be a real pain. It not only reduces your productivity but also invades your privacy with cross-website trackers.
